        <p>On our website we use cookies and other similar tools in order to improve the performance and for enhanced user experience. The policy detailed below explains how we do this.</p>

<h3>So what are cookies?</h3>

<p>Cookies are basically a type of mechanism to both store and retrieve information when one visits a website or simply put they are small text files which a website uses to function correctly and give best user experience possible. Cookies are stored on your computer, tablet or a mobile device when you first visit a site or page.</p>

<p>Some web pages in a website and HTML based emails may also contain a small snippet of code called a Web Beacon. Simply put, Web Beacons allow a website to transfer or collect information through a graphic image request. Websites use Web Beacons and cookies for many purposes, including site usage analytics, auditing advertisement investment and reporting, content and target audience personalisation.</p>

<p>In our cookie policy we use the term &ldquo;cookies&rdquo; in this policy to refer to all files that collect information in this way including Web Beacons.</p>

<p>Some cookies focus on personalization and giving better user experience, for example when a user clicks &ldquo;remember me&rdquo; when logging in, a cookie will store username. Most cookies do not collect information that identifies you. They collect general information such as how a users arrived at the websites, or a user&rsquo;s general location.</p>

<h3>What sort of cookies does the&nbsp;www.reflexologybromley.co.uk use?</h3>

<p>Generally, our cookies perform up to four different functions:</p>

<h4>First-party cookies (cookies set by us)</h4>

The subscriber of course has the choice to disable these cookies following which the user will not be able to access all of the content that a subscription entitles them to.</p>

<h5>2. Performance Cookies</h5>

<p>Our website uses other cookies to analyze and monitor performance which in turn provides a better user experience.
