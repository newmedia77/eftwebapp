  title: Depression and Anxiety
  description: Recent studies have shown that 2 out of three people in the UK suffer from some form of depression and anxiety. In fact, depression and anxiety transcend age, gender and social status. In my experience, reflexology helps on multiple levels of an individual and goes deep into underlying emotional issues. It releases hidden stress and tension without provoking negative aspects of oneâ€™s past experiences. <br />To book a session click <a href="/#top" title="Depression">here</a>
