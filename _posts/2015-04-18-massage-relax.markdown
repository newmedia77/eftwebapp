<p>It is a gentle, non-invasive technique which can help you relax, de-stress and bring into balance your state of mind. If done correctly by a qualified and experienced therapist it can help in prevention and recovery from various psychosomatic conditions. Reflexology works wonders. I have seen some profound emotional and physical changes in my clients after the reflexology sessions. From children to the elderly, people from all walks of life, everyone finds themselves energised and renewed after a session of this amazing technique.</p>

<p>During the therapy session, a reflexologist looks at the issue in a holistic manner looking into the root cause of the issue faced by the client. In the case of pre-menstrual syndrome (PMS) it is no different as the therapist works on the endocrine system together with other areas such as the nervous system, liver and the glands in the body. Around the menstrual cycle a woman can experience over 100 different types of conditions although there is still a lack of clarity as to why it happens.</p>

<p>These conditions can range from &ndash; 
<ul>
<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i>migraines and headaches</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i>anxiety</li> 
<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i>irritability</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i>constipation</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i>weight gain</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i>depression</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i>crying spells</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i>tiredness</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>But the fact remains that this conditions effects women all around the world. Some studies have found that the hormonal changes that take place during the menstrual cycle contribute greatly to this debilitating condition.</p>

<p>The results of controlled studies such as the one done by Oleson T. &amp; Flocco W. (Randomized Controlled Study of Premenstrual Symptoms &ndash; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8233263) have demonstrated a significantly greater decrease in premenstrual symptoms for the women given true reflexology treatment than for the women in the placebo group. In this study 35 women with PMS condition participated and received reflexology sessions with positive results. Post-menstrual syndrome can upset normal life leading to issues in personal relationships as well. Reflexology can bring a balance into your life. It is possible that migraines, headaches, mood swings and other conditions can be a thing of the past.</p>
