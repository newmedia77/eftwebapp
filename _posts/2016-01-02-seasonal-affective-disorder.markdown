<h2>Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) a myth?</h2>

<p>According to a study published on <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/news/2016/01January/Pages/Seasonal-affective-disorder-may-be-a-myth-study-argues.aspx" title="Seasonal Affective Disorder" target="_blank">NHS website,</a> &nbsp;Seasonal Affective Disorder or SAD is a myth. Do you agree? Have you suffered from seasonal disorder leading to depression?&nbsp;</p>

<p>The website gives the following symptoms as a result of SAD -</p>

<ul>
	<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i>a persistent low mood</li>
	<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i>a loss of pleasure or interest in normal everyday activities</li>
	<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i>irritability</li>
	<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i>feelings of despair, guilt and worthlessness</li>
	<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i>feeling lethargic (lacking in energy) and sleepy during the day</li>
	<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i>sleeping for longer than normal and finding it hard to get up in the morning</li>
	<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i>craving&nbsp;carbohydrates&nbsp;and gaining weight</li>
</ul>

<p>Thankfully, NHS website does not fully agree with the study and advices those who suffer depression to take various proactive actions such as contacting the GP, doing exercise, eating healthy etc.</p>

<p>Whatever the case may be, depression can remain dormant without anyone noticing it. Complementary therapies such as reflexology, head massage and hypnotherapy can assist with releasing stress and anxiety built up during winter months. Reflexology and Indian Head Massage have uplifting and positive effect on people in general.</p>
